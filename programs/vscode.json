            "help": "Currently only partially supported.\n\nEach of vscode's remote development extensions will create and use a `vscode-server` directory in a user's home folder each time a host is connected to.\n\nUnfortunately, the SSH extension is the only extension that has a setting that can change the location of `vscode-server`. Both the container extension and the WSL extension are missing the option of changing their `vscode-server` directories.\n\nEven so, the SSH extension only allows you to define paths for individual hosts. It doesn't allow for a default path for all ssh connections.\n\nTo edit the host paths, you either need to change your remote SSH settings in the vscode application itself, or edit your vscode user settings json file.\n\nAny changes you make need to be made on the machine you use to connect to a host, not the remote host itself.\n\n*Method 1: using the vscode application*\n\nOpen vscode and open your settings menu by pressing `Ctrl+,`.\n\nIn the search bar, type `Server Install Path` or `remote.SSH.serverInstallPath`.\n\nA setting called `Remote.SSH: Server Install Path` should appear with a map of items and values underneath its description.\n\nWith the hostname as the item and the value as `$HOME/.local/share/vscode-server`, enter each SSH remote you want to have changed.\n\nEx.\n\n| Item      | Value                            |\n| --------  | -------------------------------- |\n| hostname  | $HOME/.local/share/vscode-server |\n| hostname2 | $HOME/.local/share/vscode-server |\n\n*Method 2: editing the user settings file (settings.json)*\n\nFind and open your vscode user settings file. Depending on your platform, your user settings file can be in one of three different places:\n\n- Windows - `%APPDATA%\\Code\\User\\settings.json`\n- macOS - `$HOME/Library/Application\\ Support/Code/User/settings.json`\n- Linux - `$HOME/.config/Code/User/settings.json`\n\nSame to the application method, you need to define each individual host with its directory path in your settings file.\n\nTo add your hosts, add a map to the file with the title as `remote.SSH.serverInstallPath`, your hostnames as the items, and `$HOME/.local/share/vscode-server` as the values.\n\nEx.\n\n```json\n\"remote.SSH.serverInstallPath\": {\n    \"hostname\": \"$HOME/.local/share/vscode-server\",\n    \"hostname2\": \"$HOME/.local/share/vscode-server\"\n}\n```\n\n_Relevant issue:_ https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-release/issues/6837\n",
